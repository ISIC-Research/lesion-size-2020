# Metadata for "Consecutive biopsies for melanoma across year 2020"
## https://doi.org/10.34970/151324

This is the metadata for the dataset of 1,295 consecutive lesions biopsied to
rule out melanoma in 2020 at a tertiary cancer center in the United States,
annotated with patient demographics, lesion diameter, human labelers,
Melanocytic Pathology Assessment Tool and Hierarchy for Diagnosis (MPATH-Dx)
class for degree of dysplasia or atypia, and reference standard
histopathological diagnosis. We validated this dataset against an open-source
binary classifier for melanoma that won the International Skin Imaging
Collaboration (ISIC) grand challenge for melanoma detection in 2020 held on
Kaggle. This experiment and results were described in a paper recently
submitted to the NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.
